and go to the get started and do the steps 

-- lib/prisma.ts
    It is the ORM  -- menaing it acts as a brifge between teh db and the code

schema should be defined in -- prisma/schema.prisma
    There we create tables/schema using model keyword 
    after that migrate the schema
    by using the cmd 
        - [ npx prisma migrate dev --name init ]
        if face conflict perform
            

To run and save the schemas use 
    -> npx prisma generate
        [ Used to create and gen the schemas ]

add the lib folder for the bridge

create a new ts file to add the code to add QUERIES 

there we do 
    1. Import the prisma ORM from lib
    2. main function = 
        In this function all the queries willl be There
            "Can perform the add edit and delete queries too"
    
    3. To catch errors
        use some basic error handling techniques
